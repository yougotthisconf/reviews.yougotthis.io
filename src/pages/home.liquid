  <p>The You Got This talk review process has three parts. Firstly, each talk will be reviewed by two people and scored. Then, there will be a call between all reviewers to discuss the reviews and form a list of the top 10 submissions (using the rankings and any notes to help guide the conversation). Finally, the core You Got This team will pick a top 6 and a fallback 4 from the provided list and get in touch with speakers.</p>
  <p>You will be asked to rank each talk on the following scale: strong reject, reject, weak accept, accept, strong accept. You may optionally provide some notes that only reviewers will see to help final decision-making.</p>
  <p>Each talk will be provided without any identifying features of the speaker. This means if the speaker has referred to themselves in the talk submission (or use their pronouns) then we will convert these to a name of "Charlie Smith" and pronouns of "they/them".</p>
  <p>Ideally, we do not want to duplicate content that already has existed at You Got This events (or duplicate content by our invited keynote speakers or workshop facilitators). If topics seem similar, consider how the submitter's talk may provide more insight through a different argument or approach.</p>
  <h2>Keynote/workshop topics for this event</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Writing good CVs</li>
    <li>Making disagreements positive</li>
    <li>Marketing  and pricing yourself</li>
    <li>Building an equitable web for all</li>
    <li>Internal negotiating (once already in a job)</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Please also briefly familiarise yourself with our existing <a href="https://yougotthis.io/talks/">talk library</a> to avoid duplication. If unsure of exact talk content, ask us.</p>
